    <h3 class="text header">What is Carrot Cake?</h3>
    <p class="text para">Carrot cake is a sweet and moist spice cake, full of cut carrots and toasted nuts, and covered in cream cheese icing. 
    One part of the cake is that the orange flakes of cut carrot give the cake color and texture, along with sweetness 
    and moisture.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Cake:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>230ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tin</li>
        <li>100g natural yogurt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ orange, zested</li>
        <li>265g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>335g light muscovado sugar</li>
        <li>2½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ fresh nutmeg, finely grated</li>
        <li>265g carrots (about 3), grated</li>
        <li>100g sultanas or raisins</li>
        <li>100g walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the icing:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>100g slightly salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>300g icing sugar</li>
        <li>100g soft cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins 
            with baking parchment. Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. Mix the flour, 
            sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. Squeeze any lumps of sugar through 
            your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the nuts, if using. 
            Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. 
            If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. 
            Leave to cool in the tins.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth. Add half the soft cheese 
            and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). 
            Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing. Top with the remaining 
            icing and scatter with the remaining walnuts. Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Best 
            eaten at room temperature.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
