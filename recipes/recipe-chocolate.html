    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm round sandwich tins and line the bases 
            with baking parchment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a large bowl, beat together 200g golden caster sugar, 200g softened unsalted butter, 
            4 large eggs, 200g self-raising flour, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp vanilla extract, 
            2 tbsp milk and a pinch of salt until pale.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Divide the mixture between the prepared tins. Bake for 20 mins or until a skewer inserted into the 
            centre of the cake comes out clean.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the buttercream, put 100g chopped milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave, 
            stirring every 30 secs. Leave the melted chocolate to cool for 5 mins.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mash 200g softened butter and 400g icing sugar together with a fork, then switch to a wooden spoon or 
            electric beaters, if you have them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Sift in 5 tbsp cocoa powder with a pinch of salt and pour in the melted chocolate and 2 tbsp milk. Mix 
            again until smooth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>On a cake stand or large plate, sandwich the cakes together with half of the buttercream, then spread the 
            rest on top. Decorate with chocolate shards, if you like.</p>
        </li>
