    <h3>What is Victoria Sponge Cake?</h3>
    <p>The Victoria sponge, also known as the Victoria sandwich cake, was named after Queen Victoria, 
    who was known to enjoy the small cakes with her afternoon tea. The version Queen Victoria ate would 
    have been filled with jam alone, but modern versions often include cream.</p>
